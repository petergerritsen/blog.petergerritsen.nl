Update: The Silverlight Streaming beta has ended. If you want to host your Silverlight apps on Microsoft's infrastructure and video's check out Windows Azure

Microsoft now offers a service called [Silverlight Streaming](http://silverlight.live.com/) for hosting your Silverlight content in the cloud. At the moment the service is in beta and you get a whopping 10 GB of storagespace and 5 TB of bandwith per user account per month.

Embedding your application in a page can be done by inserting an iframe:
