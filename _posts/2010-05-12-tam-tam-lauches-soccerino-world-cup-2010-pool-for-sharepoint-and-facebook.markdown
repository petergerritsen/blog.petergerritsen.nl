At previous footbal tournaments we had a lot of success with our SharePoint football pool webparts.

This year we launch Soccerino, available on SharePoint (2007 / 2010) AND Facebook. More information on [soccerino.com](http://soccerino.com)

UPDATE: 
We have a resource file available if you want to the application in you own language. Just download the zip-file below with the javascript file with translations, update the text and send the file to us (peterge _at_ tamtam _dot_ nl). At the moment we have the following languages already covered:



	
  * English (duh)

  * German

	
  * Portugese
