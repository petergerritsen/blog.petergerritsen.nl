![A picture of me](/images/Me.jpg "A picture of me")

I work as a Senior .Net Developer at [Garansys](http://www.garansys.nl) in Utrecht, the Netherlands.

Apart from (web) application development based on the .Net Framework, I like to dive into other .Net technologies such as Silverlight and try to put some Javascript/jQuery in the mix for the best user experience results.
